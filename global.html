			<p>The ability to access drinking water is one of the fundamental elements of survival, an element that 29% of the global population lacks. Even amongst those who have water, water is frequently delivered through the means of plastic, which is not environmentally friendly. To counteract the potential plastic consumption, we found two alternatives: ooho and purifying packets. These alternatives are simply two of many which we should look to implement in the future. It’s a task which will benefit our planet in the long run.</p>

		      		<p>Perhaps a more practical alternative is a purifying technology which has the potential to cheaply purify drinking water for those who live in areas with unsanitary water. Developed by scientists originally attempting to purify dirty laundry water, P&G’s water purifying packet utilizes chemistry and only requires a packet, stick, and a cloth for the entire process. The purifying packets are cheap, and they eliminate almost all waterborne illnesses along with other pollutants. It’s a solution for places where water is available, but it’s not very sanitary.</p>
		      		<p>The packet is an ingenious solution;  it not only eliminates the need to acquire more water from elsewhere that will inevitably be shipped inside plastic but also means that people will need less to acquire drinkable water, provided that they have these packets. For example, a potential family would only need one storage container for water, instead of multiple, since water can be purified constantly.</p>

			<p id="globalNarrativeQuestion">Q: With water often packaged with plastic, what are environmentally friendly alternatives?</p>
			<br>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">Even with updates to modern technology, issues such as water storage and accessibility are still prevalent. The United Nations 6th Sustainability Goal states: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.” With 29% of the global population lacking sanitary drinking water supplies, the UN’s hope for widespread accessibility to sanitary water seems to be in a utopian future, not a reality. </p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">To be considered in conjunction with the issue of drinking water is the accompaniment of plastic. Plastic storage containers for water have become ubiquitous -- it seems that whenever water is stored, plastic is there, painfully at the side. Plastics such as these are then disposed of to the environment, where they can potentially release toxins, crowd the environment, and cause strange gene expression. Then, this begs the question of alternatives to plastics in water transportation and consumption for the future: what other options are there?</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">An alternative to plastic water storage is called ooho. Developed by the Skipping Rocks Lab in London, ooho is a seaweed-based storage unit. Imagine a soft seaweed casing for small capsules of water. Ooho can be consumed alongside the water or be peeled and thrown away. Since ooho is seaweed based, it is entirely biodegradable. Also, the proprietary material for ooho is cheaper than plastic, so if it reaches mainstream popularity in the storage of water, the economic rewards could be significant, provided ooho could be used effectively.</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">Even with potential benefits, ooho is lacking — the issue with ooho is that is that it is relatively fragile and is thus unrealistic to suggest that it could package large amounts of water similar to plastic. Thus, while it is a creative solution that avoids the constant consumption of plastic, it is perhaps a solution that is likely to be more implemented much further into the future. Since ooho is still in its infancy, there will likely be strides to be made for there to be a legitimate push for ooho as a genuine replacement for plastic in water storage. For the time being, it’s innovative and should be looked into.</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">Perhaps a more practical alternative is a purifying technology by P&G. While a purifying technology does little to help areas with a dearth of water, it can certainly make a substantial difference in areas where water is soiled and undrinkable. This packet, developed by scientists originally attempting to purify dirty laundry water, P&G’s water purifying packet only requires a packet, stick, and a cloth for the entire process. The purifying packets are cheap, and they eliminate almost all waterborne illnesses along with observable physical pollutants. *</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">	The packet is an ingenious solution — it eliminates the need to acquire more water from elsewhere that will inevitably be shipped inside plastic, which means it also lessens plastic consumption. A potential consumer would not have to constantly purchase water in plastic jugs. Instead, a singular jug could be reused, with the packet providing the consumable water in surfeit. </p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">	The ability to access drinking water is a fundamental requisite of survival, one that 29% of the global population lacks. Even amongst those lucky enough to have sanitary water, water is frequently delivered through the means of plastic, which takes a millenium to decompose. To counteract such environmentally negative effects, we must look to tenaciously examine possible alternatives, and to dream towards a future with water easily accessible to all.</p>
