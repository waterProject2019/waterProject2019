			<p id="globalNarrativeQuestion">Q: How much plastic did our school use, what are the effects, and what can we do to minimize use?</p>
			<br>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">Based on calculations and conservative estimates, we concluded that our school used about 3700 cups a day before the abrupt administrative seizure of plastic cups. This calculation was made using a t-interval and estimating that 3 jugs were used daily by the IHS population. But why does the usage of many plastic cups matter?</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">Plastic has a profound effect on the environment — plastic can severely pollute areas and release toxins that lead to gradual changes in gene expression in organisms. Our school contributes to this global ignorance of plastic disposal by not recycling plastic cups. Ithaca High School doesn’t currently recycle. The “recycling” bins are simply de facto trash cans.</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">A major consequence is the formation of an ocean of plastic. In oceans right now, there are millions of tons of plastic, even without considering other pollutants. This surfeit of plastic ruins habitats for marine life, and much of this plastic gets washed up on shore onto beaches and other coastline attractions. Frequently, we now see pictures of plastic in the stomachs of marine life or choking smaller animals in headlines, a future which could be avoided with the reduction in plastic consumption or with better care regarding plastic disposal.</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">Plastic also releases tremendous amounts of toxins as it decomposes. Plastic takes hundreds, or even thousands, of years to decompose, and toxins are constantly leaking out. These toxins find themselves in food and water of many organisms (including humans). Effectively, it means that we’re eating small amounts of plastic. </p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">With a clear dystopia painted by the effects of improper plastic disposal, it’s clear that future action is what will allow us to circumvent such a future. How can we create a world without plastic? What singular steps can we take locally to contribute?</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">An alternative that our school can implement is to lower plastic use is to open the water fountains. This could eliminate the usage of all cups. It is known that the school is looking to implement clean drinking water facilities in the future, and that in itself could largely reduce plastic consumption by our student body.</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">Another alternative could be the usage of paper cups. Paper cups are biodegradable, environmentally friendly, and are relatively cheap. They’re widely implemented globally as well. It’s an existing solution that IHS could look to implement. However, certain paper cups come with plastic lining, which complicates the recycling process. The plastic lining makes them not viable to recycle, meaning that those models should be avoided.</p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">A simple solution could be to recycle the cups rather than throw them in the trash. We are lucky in Tompkins County to have a recycling center, and the fact that IHS does not recycle is a shame, and an example of improper utilization of nearby resources. Those without recycling facilities near them would not be able to implement such an alternative, but it is a solution that our student body should push for. </p>
			<p id="globalNarrativeContent">When considering environmental issues, the overwhelming number of problems can seem insurmountable. Instead of focusing on an apocalyptic future, it is crucial to focus on smaller actions that we can take as individuals — any lasting change will be not the product of one large project, but dozens of smaller ones such as the recycling of plastic cups, cumulatively being the change for a better future.</p>

Relating to toxins, the toxins can be consumed by organisms (BPA is water soluble and can leech into food and drinks).

This is still being discovered, but what is important is that plastic dissolving does affect gene expression.</td>

		<div class="alternativeIntro">
			<p>The ability to access drinking water is one of the fundamental elements of survival, an element that 29% of the global population lacks. Even amongst those who have water, water is frequently delivered through the means of plastic, which is not environmentally friendly. To counteract the potential plastic consumption, we found two alternatives: ooho and purifying packets. These alternatives are simply two of many which we should look to implement in the future. It’s a task which will benefit our planet in the long run.</p>

		      		<p>An alternative to plastic water storage is called ooho. Developed by the Skipping Rocks Lab in London, ooho is a seaweed-based small container which eliminates the need for plastic bottles. The proprietary material for ooho is actually cheaper than plastic, so it has potential to be a global solution to plastic water storage. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj6Q-YCcA3s">Ooho Video</a> explains the effects of ooho and it’s prospective uses in a global market.</p>
		      		<p>Ooho in itself is a rather niche solution. The issue with ooho is that while it is a creative solution that avoids the constant consumption of plastic, it is perhaps a solution that is likely to be more implemented much further into the future. The machine technology that is used to create ooho casings still has further to go to become a legitimate widespread replacement for plastic casings.</p>

		      		<p>Perhaps a more practical alternative is a purifying technology which has the potential to cheaply purify drinking water for those who live in areas with unsanitary water. Developed by scientists originally attempting to purify dirty laundry water, P&G’s water purifying packet utilizes chemistry and only requires a packet, stick, and a cloth for the entire process. The purifying packets are cheap, and they eliminate almost all waterborne illnesses along with other pollutants. It’s a solution for places where water is available, but it’s not very sanitary.</p>
		      		<p>The packet is an ingenious solution;  it not only eliminates the need to acquire more water from elsewhere that will inevitably be shipped inside plastic but also means that people will need less to acquire drinkable water, provided that they have these packets. For example, a potential family would only need one storage container for water, instead of multiple, since water can be purified constantly.</p>
